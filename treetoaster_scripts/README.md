This directory contains scripts necessary to regenerate the graphs in the Evaluation section of the paper (Figures 9-13 inclusive).

Directions:

Run the shell script generate_graphs_all.sh in the treetoaster_scripts directory.
The script will download and unpack the tracefiles.
It will then generate the graphs and place the PDFs in the treetoaster_scripts/graphs directory.
